            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the introduction of my interaction design project, focused on gamifying a learning app. Our aim is to make the learning experience more engaging and interactive for our users.</p>
            <p>Gamification involves applying game design principles to non-game contexts, such as education. The objective is to increase user motivation, engagement, and enjoyment.</p>
            <p>This project involved various phases, including a competitive analysis, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing. The competitive analysis will help me identify strengths and weaknesses in the existing market and highlight areas we can improve.</p>
